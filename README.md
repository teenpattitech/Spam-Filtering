<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/teenpattitech/Spam-Filtering)

With the help of text-classifier algorithms, rejecting mails based on text analysis can be serious problem in case of false positives. Normally users and organizations would not want any genuine e-mails to be lost. Black list approach has been one of the earliest approaches tried for the filtering of spams. 

The strategy is to accept all the mails except the ones from the domain/e-mail ids. With newer domains entering the category of spamming domains this strategy tends to not work so well. White list approach is the strategy of accepting the mails from the domains/addresses explicitly white listed and put others in a less priority queue, which is delivered only after sender responds to a confirmation request sent by the spam filtering system.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
